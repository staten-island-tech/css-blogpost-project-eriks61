      <h1>The Best Soccer Teams in the World</h1>
      <h2>Number 1</h2>

      <h3>
        Fc Barcelona is in the first spot for me because of their rich history.
        Many would argue that Real Madrid is a better team than Barca in Spain
        because they've won more trophies, but Barcelona has beat them more than
        they've lost to them. They also spend less moeny on buying players and
        focus on their youth academy.

      <h2>Number 2</h2>
      <h2><img src="norwich.jpg" alt="" /></h2>
      <h3>
        My second spot goes to Norwich FC, which is a club in the second tier of
        English soccer. While they are not the best team in the world, they have
        a rich history and have always been able to compete at the top level
        with a limited amount of money. They also have amazing kits, with their
        yellow shirts with green.

      <h2>Number 3</h2>
      <h2><img src="malaga.jpg" alt="" /></h2>
      <h3>
        The third and final spot on this list goes to another team with heritage
        that isn't at the top level anymore, as they are in the third division
        in Spain. However, they have spent a lot of time in the top league,
        producing players such as the 2012 golden boy award winner Isco Alarcon.
